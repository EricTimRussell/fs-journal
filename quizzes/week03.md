# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern

**1.** What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
-Abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and Encapsulation.
```
**2.** How would you access the `name` of the below object using the `property` variable?
```js
let staff = {
  name: "Tim",
  age: 26,
  job: "Code Monkey"
  }
let property = 'name'
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
-property = staff['name']
```
**3.** What is Encapsulation?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
-Encapsulation is a way of keeping data secure from users as well as keeping data more organized.
```
**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
-Single Responsibility
```
**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
-A Class is when you are actually defining properties inside the class. Instance of class is when you essentially copy the Class variables and make instances of these variables that can be changed without changing the original.
```
**6.** What is a `Proxy` object?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
-Proxy objects are re-usable code objects that can take on the values of another object without having to write out 2 seperate objects.
```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
-It creates more organized code and more importantly it allows developers to protect their data that they do not want the user to have access to. Also it is used to torture students learning to program.
```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
-The controllers job is to make changes to the DOM that the user can see and interact with.
```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
-The service is there to manipulate any data that it receives.
```
**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
-The model holds all the data that is used to create whatever the data dictates.
```
