## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

-Scope is where variables are available for use. Either globally or locally available for use.

2. What is Hoisting ?

-It is a javascript mechanism where variables and function declaration are moved to the top of their scope.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

-From what I understand var can be used if you need a variable that is global and redefinable but that can also be a problem for re-use and so var is not used much anymore. Let is block scoped and is going to be a coders primary use for variable declaration. And a developer would then use const if they wanted to keep the variable unchanged throughout its use.
