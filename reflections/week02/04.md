## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

-It will improve the quality of your code, but also planning small portions wrather than the whole project is going to be better because your code or what makes sense will likely change.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

-If a TA is available I will try and ask them. Otherwise I generally start with the resources that BCW has provided us then i will use MDN or W3 and after that I will use google.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

-One is how most of coding is alot of planning and piecing things together not just writing code. And that code that works may not be the best way to do whatever the code does.
