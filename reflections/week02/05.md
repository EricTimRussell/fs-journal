# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

-What went well/hard? By the time we made it to the boss fight project I was starting to connect the dots of how to use javascricpt logically. I really had a hard time with Ice cream parlor project and it shows, but I feel i have redeemed myself with boss fight and our checkpoint.

-I still have some issues with arrays at times trying to understand how to pull objects from them without breaking my function.
