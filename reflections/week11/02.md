## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

-Primary keys are unique to each table. Foreign keys are used as a way to reference to another table using that tables primary key.

2. What is an `Alias`?

-It is when you alias out a table for example calling account "a" rather than typing account everytime it is being referenced

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)
SELECT d.patientId, p.doctorId FROM patients p JOIN doctors d on d.id = p.patientId
WHERE p.doctorId = @doctorId  
```
