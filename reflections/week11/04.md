## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

-I plan to manage my time by getting the easy busy work out of the way over the weekend and have my server side stuff mostly completed by monday. Then will delve into the more complicated stuff during the week where I will be able to focus more and get help when I need it. I am concerned I will run out of time there is so much stuff to complete and I still do not fully understand vue sometimes which slows me down.

-Overall im pretty happy with the progression of the course. I wish it were longer as there is alot to learn in such a short amount of time. I am feeling confident that I could create my own website from scratch albeit a simple one. In terms of feeling job ready I am kinda unsure if I reached that level of competency where I could jump into the job market and know what I am talking about to an interviewer.I suppose I am not familiar with what are the expectations of a junior developer. However, after the course I will be studying and practicing alot more escpecially on some of the terminology. Personally I wish we would have learned c# and sql earlier in the course. I really like c# and sql as I find it to be way easier to understand than node. Also I wish we would have spent another week learning vue or maybe a couple days more. Week 6 was brutal for me I would consider it the hardest week.
