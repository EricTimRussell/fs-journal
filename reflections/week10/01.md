## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

-Value, Reference, and pointer. Value stores its value directly, reference stores data within another container and it points to that container that contains the data. And pointer types reference a location where the data is stored.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

-bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, and ushort. Differnces include: there are alot more options compared to javascript as well as they have actuall memory sizes.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

-References are stored in another location then that references the actual data's location. Pointers point directly to the data's address from what I understand wrather then storing the pointer as another value.
