## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

-A row contains all the data of a specific object. Where as a column is only 1 specific type of data that can be associated with all the rows in a table.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

-CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(id int name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, age int NOT NULL, description VARCHAR(255) );

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
-Drop table removes the entire table where delete from lets you add conditions of what you want to delete.
