# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

1- Things went well mostly I did not get the feeling of drinking from a firehose.
3- D-flex is still a tad tricky, however I have seen an improvement.
4- Keeping my cool this whole week it was certainly an intimidating experience just to start a code bootcamp.
