## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

-Pseudo-classes are modifiers we can add to css selectors. Hover and probably nth of type those seem to be fairly usefull.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

-Specificity sets priority of each element. This can be useful because you can use a tag name to target all tags and class/id to target specific elements within tags.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

-I assume it may cause too many conflicts if over-utilized as well as creat a messy environment.
