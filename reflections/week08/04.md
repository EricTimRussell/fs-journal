## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

-unit testing, component testing, and end-to-end testing. Unit testing allows developers to test individual units of code. Component testing is testing larger chunks of code that a developer can see on the DOM. End-to-end testing is testing the front-end aspects as well as the relevant back end code.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

-From what I understand I would say component testing as unit testing is too narrow and end-to-end testing may be too broad and may give false positives. 

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

-Unit testing not because it isn't useful but because it is very narrow testing and requires lots of tests over multiple units to produce broader results.
