# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

-I completed all the req's on my checkpoint and then some. I count that as a big victory as I struggled on some parts but managed to understand what I needed to do in order to get the project done.

-Still kinda having a some small issues with mvc pattern. Mainly grasping the service part.

-Api's are really cool will definetly be using them on personal projects when I have the time.
