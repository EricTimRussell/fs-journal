> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

-Messing looking code and having large amounts of ({ at the end of your code.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

-Asynchronous means that functions take time before they produce a result. Callbacks are used to initiate this delay and then produce a result when it is complete.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

-Keeping code shallow meaning your code doesn't start forming a large pyramid shape by starting your functions on their own line. Modularize by creating seperate files for each of your functions. Handle every single error by writing error catchers at the beginning of your code and plan for there to be errors.
