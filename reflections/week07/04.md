![replace_me](https://codeworks.blob.core.windows.net/public/assets/img/illustrations/placeholder.svg)

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

-Mainly I was trying to put myself in the shoes of whoever the end user would be and organize my pages in a logical format.

2. What went well this week?

-My server side went well I managed to finish that within a day. Server side for whatever reason flows more logically in my head compared to front end.

3. What would you do differently?

-I probably would of spent more of my time studying Vue when I got stuck rather than pulling my hair out staring at my screen trying to figure out what to do. Vue has been a difficult transition for me more so than MVC.
